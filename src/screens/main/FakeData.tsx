      "Another success story concerns the downlisting from Critically Endangered to Endangered of Millerbird, a Hawaiian reed-warbler, thanks to translocation efforts. However, other Hawaiian endemics tell a different story, as rising temperatures, invasive alien species and disease mean two species of honeycreeper – Anianiau and Kauai Amakihi – have been uplisted from Vulnerable to Endangered. Elsewhere, Juan Fernandez Tit-tyrant, endemic to Robinson Crusoe Island off the coast of Chile, suffers from the impacts of invasive species and native plant loss, and has been uplisted from Near Threatened to Endangered.\n" +
      "Island endemics are not the only bird species struggling. Citron-throated Toucan has experienced considerable population declines, moving from Least Concern to Near Threatened due to the ongoing effect of forest loss in South America. Palm Cockatoo has also been uplisted from Least Concern to Near Threatened, due to habitat loss, particularly the loss of hollows in trees needed for breeding and, on New Guinea, apparently increasing intensities of trapping for the pet trade.\n" +
      "In South-East Asia, lowland forest loss continues to drive rapid population declines, with Cinnamon-rumped Trogon now uplisted from Near Threatened to Vulnerable. Great Bustard has been uplisted from Vulnerable to Endangered due to a range of threats across Eurasia,",
